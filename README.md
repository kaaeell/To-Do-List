# To Do List

A simple task manager I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks needed—just open it in your browser and start adding tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all completed tasks at once
- Your tasks are saved locally (they'll be there when you come back)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start adding tasks!

Type a task in the input box and hit Enter or click the Add button. Click the checkbox to mark tasks done, and use the Delete button to remove them.

## What's Inside

- `index.html` - Main structure
- `style.css` - Styling
- `script.js` - All the functionality
- `README.md` - You're reading it

## Local Storage

Tasks are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they stick around even after you close the tab. Clear your browser data and they'll disappear.
